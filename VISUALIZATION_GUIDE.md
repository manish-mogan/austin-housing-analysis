# Visualization Guide: Property Value Distribution Over Time

## Visual 1: Property Value Distribution Over Time (Austin vs. U.S.)

### Overview
This interactive visualization demonstrates how Austin's housing market has shifted dramatically toward higher-priced homes over the past decade (2015-2023) compared to national trends.

### Purpose
By highlighting Austin's disproportionate share of expensive homes, this visualization directly supports arguments about affordability challenges in the Austin housing market.

### Static Preview

*The image above shows snapshots from 2015, 2019, and 2023. The full interactive version with a year slider is available in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.*

### Key Findings

#### 2015 Baseline
- **Austin**: 38.0% of homes were affordable (<$200K)
- **Austin**: 13.4% of homes were expensive ($500K+)

#### 2023 Current State
- **Austin**: Only 5.7% of homes are affordable (<$200K)
- **Austin**: 51.4% of homes are expensive ($500K+)

#### Dramatic Shift
- **Decrease in Affordable Homes**: -32.3 percentage points
- **Increase in Expensive Homes**: +38.0 percentage points

This represents a complete transformation of the Austin housing market, with affordable homes nearly disappearing while expensive properties now dominate.

### Design Elements

#### Color Scheme
The visualization uses a sequential color palette that creates a clear visual gradient:
- **Light Blue** (#deebf7) - < $100,000 (most affordable)
- **Medium Blue** (#9ecae1) - $100,000 - $199,999
- **Green** (#4daf4a) - $200,000 - $299,999
- **Yellow** (#ffff33) - $300,000 - $399,999
- **Orange** (#ff7f00) - $400,000 - $499,999
- **Red** (#e31a1c) - $500,000 - $749,999
- **Deep Red** (#800026) - $750,000+ (most expensive)

#### Interactivity Features
1. **Year Slider**: Move through years 2015-2023 to see how distributions evolve
2. **Hover Tooltips**: Display detailed information including:
   - Region name
   - Year
   - Price range
   - Share percentage
   - Number of homes

#### Chart Type
- **Stacked Bar Chart** with normalized percentages
- Allows easy comparison between Austin and U.S. trends
- Each bar represents 100% of housing stock
- Segments show proportion in each price range
