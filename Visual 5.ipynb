    "# Visual 5: Homeownership Housing Trends in Austin\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization illustrates how Austin's housing composition has shifted over time, with a declining share of owner-occupied homes and a corresponding rise in renter-occupied units. It supports our claim that increasing housing costs are making ownership less attainable for many residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "- Interactive line graph showing owner-occupied housing share from 2013 to 2023\n",
    "- Hover functionality displaying exact percentage for each year\n",
    "- Zoom and pan capabilities for exploring specific time periods\n",
    "- Range slider for focusing on shorter or recent periods (e.g., 2020-2023)\n",
    "- 50% reference line marking the threshold where renters would equal owners\n",
    "- Key annotations highlighting the peak ownership (2020) and subsequent decline"

    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization clearly shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Renters Have Always Been the Majority**: Throughout the entire period (2013-2023), owner-occupied homes have never exceeded 50%, meaning renters have consistently outnumbered homeowners in Austin\n",
    "2. **Peak and Decline**: Owner-occupied housing reached its peak at 45.5% in 2020, but has since declined sharply\n",
    "3. **Recent Decline**: From 2020 to 2023, the owner-occupied share dropped from 45.5% to 44.4%, a decline of over 1 percentage point in just 3 years\n",
    "4. **Connection to Affordability**: This declining trend correlates with rising housing costs, making homeownership increasingly difficult for Austin residents\n",
    "5. **Widening Gap**: The gap between renters and owners continues to grow, with renters now representing approximately 55.6% of all occupied housing\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive features allow you to:\n",
    "- Use the range slider to focus on specific periods (e.g., 2020-2023 for recent trends)\n",
    "- Zoom and pan to examine the data in detail\n",
    "- Hover over data points to see exact percentages for each year"
