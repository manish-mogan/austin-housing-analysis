- **Researchers**: Study correlation between property features and prices

## Technical Details

### Data Source
- **File**: `data.csv`
- **Records**: 15,171 properties
- **Location**: Austin, Texas metropolitan area

### Technology Stack
- **Visualization**: Altair 5.5.0 (with JSON data transformer enabled for large datasets)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.3.3
- **Statistics**: SciPy 1.16.2, NumPy 2.3.4
- **Environment**: Python 3.12.3

### Important Note on Data Size
The visualization uses Altair's JSON data transformer (`alt.data_transformers.enable('json')`) to handle the 15,171 property records, which exceeds Altair's default 5,000-row limit. This transformer saves the data to temporary JSON files instead of embedding it directly in the visualization, enabling smooth rendering of large datasets.

### Amenity Score Calculation
The amenity score (0-5) is calculated by counting these features:
- Garage (hasGarage)
- Air Conditioning (hasCooling)
- Heating (hasHeating)
- Spa (hasSpa)
- View (hasView)

## Accessibility
- High-contrast color palette for school quality categories
- Clear legends and annotations
- Large, readable text labels
- Color-blind friendly palette selection

## Notes
- The RÂ² value of 0.2181 indicates a weak positive correlation between living area and price
- This suggests that while size matters, other factors (location, school quality, amenities) significantly influence pricing
- The visualization enables exploration of these multifaceted relationships
